                  Reduces penalties imposed on your firing at a target obscured to you
                  by darkness, smoke, fog, etc. to 0. Looking through the scope, you can
                  distinguish hot meat from cold metal, but not more specifically than that.
                  You can’t tell the brand of their Cyberarm from a distance, or see any of
                  its internal surprises, for example.</td>

                  uninstalling a Smartgun Link takes an hour. A weapon is a Smartgun
                  only when it has a Smartgun Link attached to it. Special Cyberware
                  is required to take advantage of a Smartgun. A Smartgun Link must be
                  connected to you with Interface Plugs or a Subdermal Grip in order to
                  operate, both of which require you to have a Neural Link. A Subdermal
                  Grip connects a Smartgun held in it automatically. You can plug in
                  Interface Plugs as part of drawing a Smartgun into a free hand, as long
                  as your Interface Plugs aren't already plugged into something else.
                  Being disarmed of your Smartgun doesn't snap your cables, it just unplugs
                  them from the Smartgun. Plugging them back in isn't an Action should you
                  have the Smartgun in your hand, as their ports are designed for 
                  ease-of-use. Why go through all this trouble? Because when making
                  Ranged Attacks with one, you add a +1 to your Check.
